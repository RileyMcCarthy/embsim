//! The yourproject catalog: the kinds this project adds to embsim
//! (`PROJECTS.md` §10, "Extending embsim from a project").
//!
//! `embsim new --catalog` started this crate with one example of each sort
//! of kind a catalog can add, so a project file can name all four at once:
//!
//! | Kind | Sort | In the project file |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `yourproject-board` | a board: a netlist this crate bundles | `[[board]] kind = "yourproject-board"` |
//! | `yourproject-sensor` | a part model | `[[board.model]] value = "YOURPROJECT-SENSOR"`, `kind = "yourproject-sensor"` |
//! | `yourproject-core` | what runs inside the P2's package | `[board.model.options] core = "yourproject-core"`, `pin = 0` |
//! | `yourproject-source` | a bench component that acts over time | `[[component]] kind = "yourproject-source"`, `volts`, `ohms`, `at` |
//!
//! Keep the ones the project needs, rename them, and write the rest. Three
//! rules bind them as they bind embsim's own (`DESIGN.md`):
//!
//! - **Every number has its source.** A model's figures come from its
//!   part's datasheet, each with its citation beside it; a figure the
//!   bench sets (a supply's volts) is an option the project file gives.
//!   None of these examples holds a figure of its own for that reason.
//! - **One interface.** A model talks to the board through its declared
//!   pins: drives it publishes, senses it is handed, wakes it schedules.
//!   A mechanism (a shaft, a carriage) stays inside one component, which
//!   presents electrical pins.
//! - **Nothing starts at registration.** `embsim survey` and `new`
//!   register every kind and build nothing; a thread starts, or a core
//!   runs, when the board or the bench is built.
//!
//! [`register`] is what the runner the `embsim` tool builds calls: keep its
//! name and signature. A finished catalog of this shape, with a test that
//! runs its project, is `examples/custom-project` in the embsim repository.
