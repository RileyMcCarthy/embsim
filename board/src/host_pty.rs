//! The host's end of a serial link, as a board component.
//!
//! A PTY on one side, two digital pins on the other. Whatever a host program
//! writes to the PTY is framed onto a net as edges; whatever the net carries
//! back is deframed and handed to the host.
//!
//! # Why a net and not a file descriptor
//!
//! The straightforward way to give a simulated device a serial port is to hand
//! the PTY master straight to whatever models its UART — the bytes never touch
//! a net, and it works. What it cannot do is go wrong the way a wire goes
//! wrong. Here the same descriptor sits behind a [`SerialLevelBridge`], so the
//! host's traffic crosses the same net the device's does, at the same rate,
//! framed the same way, and a baud mismatch or a broken idle level produces
//! the framing errors it would on a bench rather than being defined away.
//!
//! # Threading
//!
//! Nothing on a net-resolution path may block on a file descriptor, so reading
//! the host is a pump thread's job. The engine thread only ever *queues* bytes
//! for the host (`deliver`) and the pump drains whatever the PTY would not
//! take — see that function for why dropping instead would be much worse than
//! it looks.
